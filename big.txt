Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
It is designed to build scalable network applications.

Streams in Node.js allow you to work with large amounts of data efficiently.
Instead of reading the whole file at once, data is processed in small chunks.

This makes streams very useful for handling big files such as videos, logs,
or large text files without consuming too much memory.

Readable streams are used to read data.
Writable streams are used to write data.
Transform streams can modify data while it is being passed.

Learning streams is an important part of mastering Node.js backend development.
They are widely used in real-world applications and production systems.

This file is intentionally long to demonstrate how Node.js reads data in chunks.
Each chunk will be logged separately in the terminal when using streams.
