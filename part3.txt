1. What is the Node.js Event Loop?

The Event Loop is a mechanism in Node.js that allows it to perform non-blocking asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the call stack and the event queue, and executes callbacks when the call stack is empty.

2. What is Libuv and What Role Does It Play in Node.js?

Libuv is a C library used by Node.js to handle asynchronous operations. It provides the event loop, manages the thread pool, and handles tasks like file system operations, networking, and timers.

3. How Does Node.js Handle Asynchronous Operations Under the Hood?

Node.js offloads asynchronous tasks (such as file I/O or timers) to Libuv. Once the task is completed, its callback is placed in the event queue, and the event loop executes it when the call stack becomes empty.

4. What is the Difference Between the Call Stack, Event Queue, and Event Loop in Node.js?

Call Stack: Executes synchronous code line by line.

Event Queue: Holds callbacks of completed asynchronous operations.

Event Loop: Monitors the call stack and moves callbacks from the event queue to the call stack when it is empty.

5. What is the Node.js Thread Pool and How to Set the Thread Pool Size?

The thread pool is managed by Libuv and is used to handle expensive operations like file system access and cryptography.
The default size is 4 threads and can be changed using:

UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=number

6. How Does Node.js Handle Blocking and Non-Blocking Code Execution?

Blocking code stops the execution of the program until it finishes, while non-blocking code runs asynchronously and allows other operations to continue. Node.js uses non-blocking I/O to improve performance and scalability.
